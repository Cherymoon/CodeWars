Assume "#" is like a backspace in string. This means that string "a#bc#d" actually is "bd"

Your task is to process a string with "#" symbols.

Examples
"abc#d##c"      ==>  "ac"
"abc##d######"  ==>  ""
"#######"       ==>  ""
""              ==>  ""

function cleanString(s) {
  let r = ''
  for(let i=0 ; i<s.length ;i++)
  {
    r += s[i]
    if(r[r.length-1] == '#')
    {
      r = r.slice(0,r.length-2)
    }
  }
  return r
};

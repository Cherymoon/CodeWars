Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:

my_list = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

Resposta:

using System.Linq;
public static class Kata
{
  public static object[] RemoveEveryOther(object[] arr)
  {
    return arr.Where((p,i) => i%2 == 0).ToArray();
  }
}

Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

1450 -> 145
960000 -> 96
1050 -> 105
-1050 -> -105
Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway

    public static int NoBoringZeros(int n) 
    {
      string aux = n.ToString();
      while(aux[aux.Length-1] == '0' && aux.Length > 1)
      {
        aux = aux.Substring(0,aux.Length-1);
      }
      return int.Parse(aux);
    }
}
